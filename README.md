# React Project - Integration with Liturgia API

This project was developed using **React**, **Vite**, and **Tailwind CSS**, and integrates with the [Liturgia API](https://liturgia.up.railway.app/), providing liturgical data such as celebrations and readings.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **Vite**: For fast and efficient bundling and development server.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For utility-first styling.
- **Liturgia API**: Used to fetch liturgical data, including celebrations and readings.

## Development stages

- First, API research was done to find out how to retrieve the data. The search was done with help of the Chat GPT.

## Future Plans

- Addition of an AI, which generates images, based on the text of the Gospel.
- Addition of differents windows, with different content. For example, a canvas of the saint of the day.
- Make a background that change the color, based on the Liturgic Color of the day.
